# Nonopoly

_Demonstrate how a adaptable ruleset based on liquid democrasy leads to a prosperous humanity_

## Context

The precuror to the game Monopoly was a game named the [Landlords
Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly#Game_development_1903%E2%80%931934): 

 > In 1903, Georgist Lizzie Magie applied for a patent on a game called The
 > Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched property
 > owners and impoverished tenants.

(pronounced none- opoloy) is created to denomonstrate the positive attributes
